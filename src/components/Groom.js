He currently has 2 nephews and hopes for another one coming soon ;) He has lived in Idaho, Wyoming and Missouri. In his youth, he was constantly getting stitches and was a wild child. As he got older, sports became an outlet for him. He found joy being on a team and having his dad as his basketball couch, when in his youth. He plans on attending Brigham Young University-Idaho and majoring in Construction Management.
