            We want to thank everyone for their love and support and excitement that you have shared with us since our engagement. It feels so amazing to have such loving family and friends, we don’t know what we would do without each and every one of you.

Our planning is going smoothly and it’s thanks to many of you who have stepped up and offered to help with so many different aspects of our big day. We love you all and can’t wait to celebrate in style! Don’t forget your dancing shoes!
