        <p>
        Jordan and I's love story started out pretty ordinary but over time we created something together that was extraordinary. Jordan and I met through mutual friends located in Pocatello, ID. We hit it off at the beginning and dated on and off for a year. We confided in each other about our own dating lives and families when we were away from each other and It wasn't until the Fall of 2017 Jordan and I became serious. Things obviously progressed fast at that point and he decided to put a ring on it! He asked me to marry him on December 9th up at the palisades reservoir. Soon after I let for an internship up in Minneapolis, MN for 4 months. He came out to visit me for Valentines day and even came to work with me for a few occasions. Long distance was definitely challenging but we were determined to make the best of the situation. When I came back, we were inseparable from each other and we have been ever since! Time together is so important to us, Jordan decided to make the move up to Rexburg, ID and has been working for Jacobson Concrete. We love to spend time in the outdoors, help my parents landscape their yard, go up to island park for explore, have Netflix dates, go to the temple together and wrestle with the sprinklers on. We are both to grateful we met each other and grateful for each and everyday we have together.
